# SWAPI
Uses jQuery ajax to get and display data from the Star Wars API (swapi.co)

Find the Star Wars API here: https://swapi.co/

Documentation is here: https://swapi.co/documentation

Note that SWAPI requires no authentication.

This project provides an item list for each SWAPI resource type (Films, People, Starships, etc.).  Clicking on an item shows item detail in raw text.  Obviously...this simply interface could be improved!
